# Digital-Information-Modulation-Schemes
Performance of Different Modulation types (ASK – FSK – PSK).

<br /> ASK has many cases, but the case we are interested in here is the special case which is called
OOK.
<br /> PSK has many cases, but the case we are interested in here is the special case which is called
PRK.
<br /> FSK has many cases, but the case we are interested in here is the special case which is called
orthogonal-FSK, in which the 2 transmitted bits are sent on 2 orthogonal carriers.

<br />
<br />the following is the comparison plot between the performance of the previous digital modulation schemes
